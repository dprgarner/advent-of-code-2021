### Some notes:

I start on N rolls. I have scored X, and am in position Y. There are f(N,X,Y) universes in which this is possible.
What can I roll?
- 1 way  to roll a 3. Add 1*f(N,X,Y) to f(N+1, X+(Y+3)$10, (Y+3)$10).
- 3 ways to roll a 4. Add 3*f(N,X,Y) to f(N+1, X+(Y+4)$10, (Y+4)$10).
...
- 1 way  to roll a 9. Add 1*f(N,X,Y) to f(N+1, X+(Y+9)$10, (Y+9)$10).

We iterate from X=0 to X=20. You never roll if X is 21 or higher.
